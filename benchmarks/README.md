# Benchmark Baselines

This directory stores CPU-signature keyed baseline files for release perf gates.

## Layout

- `benchmarks/baselines/<signature>.json` - generated by `scripts/perf/perf_gate.py`
- `benchmarks/reports/` - generated markdown/json reports from CI jobs (not committed)

## Generate baseline locally

```bash
python scripts/perf/perf_gate.py --allow-missing-baseline
```

The script runs `perf_probe` by default and writes a baseline file for your detected CPU.

## Compare current probe against baseline

```bash
python scripts/perf/perf_gate.py --threshold-percent 5
```

Exit code is non-zero on regression above threshold.
